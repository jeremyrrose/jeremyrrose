## Node.js Development

### :: [Mongoose Live](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/mongoose-live)
A simple REPL integration for Mongoose, taking advantage of Node v10+'s `--experimental-repl-await` flag. Installable as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-live_) or via [NPX with configuration menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mongoose-live).

## Educational Tools

### :: [Rainbow Sorts](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/rainbow-sorts)
A suite of colorful Node.js-based visualizations for commonly learned sorting algorithms. Designed to leverage intuitively recognizable patterns (the Latin alphabet and a consistent color scheme) to aid in student understanding of each sort.

## Software Curriculum Development

### :: [Record Collection](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/record-collection)
Four-part instructional lab designed to model beginning-to-end
problem solving using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express and jQuery.

### :: [React Crash Course](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/react-workshop)
A weeklong workshop built to introduce React to a group of recent bootcamp grads. Using their prior experience with Vue.js as scaffold, students produced simple React projects to connect with pre-built Django APIs.

### :: OOP Barnyard ([JS](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/js-barnyard) / [Ruby](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/ruby-barnyard))
Two interactive "playground" activities built to illustrate introductory OOP concepts with study questions and open-ended suggestions for development. [Ruby Barnyard](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/ruby-barnyard) is integrated with Pry, while [JS Barnyard](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/js-barnyard) is built to run in the Node REPL.

### :: [Promises Explained](https://github.com/jeremyrrose/promises-explained)
A one-hour lesson expanding upon students' practical knowledge of JS promises, `async`, and `await` to offer a peek "under the hood."
